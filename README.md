Man, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 When Life Gives You Tangerines, and honestly, I'm all over the place with my thoughts right now. Like, it was good, but also kinda what-the-heck at some points, you know what I mean? There’s this moment where it’s all deep and emotional, and you’re like, “Oh yeah, totally,” and then suddenly, boom, someone’s throwing tangerines around like it's an Olympic sport. Seriously, where did that come from?

It’s kinda like life, right? You think you’re going down this one road, things get real and meaningful, and then bam, tangerines. I mean, who wrote this stuff? And not to mention that one scene with the grandma – why did it feel like she’s dropping wisdom bombs and then the next minute she’s just... there, staring into space like she forgot her lines. But dude, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just for those bits, trust me.

> And oh my gosh, the soundtrack! Give me a second to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   soundtrack, just to replay that one jam on repeat. Sometimes it's like all it takes is the right tune to get you through those weirdly disjointed moments, yeah? And I'm pretty sure the romance subplot pulled a fast one on us. One minute they're all cutesy and next it's like a horror flick, hearts racing, tension high, and I’m sitting there going like, what in the world happened?!

Anyway, it’s not all wacky; parts of it hit home pretty well. That whole metaphor with the tangerines and life’s unexpected twists—made me chuckle. Then again, maybe I’m just overthinking a   about fruit. Whatever, I'm glad I did 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   cause I kinda want to go through it again, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Guess it’s one of those where you find new bits each time you re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩.

people = [you, me, weird-feeling-moments]

Okay, I'm rambling. Maybe it's just   hangover setting in. You should definitely check it out though, it's a trip. Let me know what you think or if I'm just nuts here. I’m off to grab some actual tangerines, feeling inspired I guess. Later! 🍊
